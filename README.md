PyLMPlayer
==========
A Player for playing and rendering LM format.(A format found in Taiko no tatsujin portable DX).

Note:
  This project is at very early stage and far from mature.

How to play:
  Because it uses official resources from original game, i can't upload those fatasitic images and swfs.
  Ask me for a pack of resource and combine that unzipped folder with `packages` folder.

Dependencies:
  Pyglet.
