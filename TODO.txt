# 7. optimization. play with numba or Cython.
# 9. implement font, static text, edit text, button, etc.
#12. bubbles in DANCE_BG_10.LM experiences a significant slow down. If i remember right, i don't have #    this problem before.

#15.
#16.

# DONE
# 8. try wii version. 
#      frame rate almost the same, so, my player is most 
#    probably cpu bounded.
#
# 4. DANCE_BG_10.LM bubble flashs. 
#      Bug fixed, a mc which is inited in the 
#    current frame should not advance in the same frame
#
# 6. Sprite not complete matching together. metedai?dancebg05
#      tag shape can define a boundbox smaller than the filling image.fixed.
#
#11. make get_id method of tag class a normal method.(not class method!!)
#      In fact, I don't know how to use this..., so remove.
#
#10. optimization. create vertex for sprite only once.
#      haven't check if this really improves.
