# TODO:
# 1. introduce `scene`
# 3. fscommand(used everywhere for callback)
# 7. optimization. play with numba or Cython.
# 9. implement font, static text, edit text, button, etc.
#12. bubbles in DANCE_BG_10.LM experiences a significant slow down. 
#      If i remember right, i don't have this problem before.
#      It seems that too many color composition and matrix math is the main #      cost.but i already have an idea in my mind~~~see 15.
#14. Don't use opengl api to do matrix calculation
#15. try to implement a dirty render state algorithm.
#16. try to map all leafs to a list.(not too hard)
#18.
#19.

# DONE
# 8. try wii version. 
#      frame rate almost the same, so, my player is most 
#    probably cpu bounded.
#
# 4. DANCE_BG_10.LM bubble flashs. 
#      Bug fixed, a mc which is inited in the 
#    current frame should not advance in the same frame
#
# 6. Sprite not complete matching together. metedai?dancebg05
#      tag shape can define a boundbox smaller than the filling image.fixed.
#
#11. make get_id method of tag class a normal method.(not class method!!)
#      In fact, I don't know how to use this..., so remove.
#
#10. optimization. create vertex for sprite only once.
#      haven't check if this really improves.
#
#13. optimization. play with cProfile.
#      have use cProfile to find the hot spot.creating too much color instance.
#
#17. try reuse color instance.
#      Better, but not satisfied.I should avoid doing math completely when there's no change.
