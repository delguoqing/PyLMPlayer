# TODO:
# 9. implement font, static text, edit text, button, etc.
#21. support property _visible, _parent, _root
#25. Use vertex array to do batch while avoid a fixed-length vbo.
#26. Use index to specify all the transformation(matrix, color, blend_mode, etc).And move the whole render code to C level.
#29. combo not set correctly
#30. onp moji has no lm file.handle those text specially.
#31. DON_GEKI_1P.LM has not implemented tag!
	0x0007: Button2,
	0xF018: Button Record.
#32. try to arrange the order of LM files.(For best performance)
#33. adjust clip depth implementation.
#34.

# DONE
# 8. try wii version. 
#      frame rate almost the same, so, my player is most 
#    probably cpu bounded.
#
# 4. DANCE_BG_10.LM bubble flashs. 
#      Bug fixed, a mc which is inited in the 
#    current frame should not advance in the same frame
#
# 6. Sprite not complete matching together. metedai?dancebg05
#      tag shape can define a boundbox smaller than the filling image.fixed.
#
#11. make get_id method of tag class a normal method.(not class method!!)
#      In fact, I don't know how to use this..., so remove.
#
#10. optimization. create vertex for sprite only once.
#      haven't check if this really improves.
#
#13. optimization. play with cProfile.
#      have use cProfile to find the hot spot.creating too much color instance.
#
#17. try reuse color instance.
#      Better, but not satisfied.I should avoid doing math completely when there's no change.
#19. may be I can measure render depth, and count draw counts.
DANCE_BG_04.LM
Render Statistic Peak:
        113 nodes visited
        79 primitive draw
        max recursive depth: 5
DANCE_BG_10.LM
Render Statistic Peak:
        110 nodes visited
        52 primitive draw
        max recursive depth: 7
DANCE_BG_12.LM
Render Statistic Peak:
        138 nodes visited
        89 primitive draw
        max recursive depth: 6
can we just advance and draw in one call?
if i have to visit so many nodes and cost so much on recursive function call
i can do drawing in the same visit.
#20. Try to do drawing and update in the just one visit
   Yes, it helps.
# 1. introduce `scene`
	load multiple lm files
# 3. fscommand(used everywhere for callback)
	just add an arg in do script call
#24. Using a solid color texture instead of introducing a new filling mode.
	Shapes can have a fill style type called solid fill(0x0).This 	
	causes trouble for batching.We can eliminate this by creating a 1x1 
	texture of the fill color.
#22. [Important!] Dynamic batching!
	Done, much improvement seen. But fail on some file, such as 	
	DANCE_BG_04.LM, which switch context will quickly.And also, use a 
	fixed vbo means to fill extra vertices data, when a batch fails to 
	fill the vbo fully.
#12. bubbles in DANCE_BG_10.LM experiences a significant slow down. 
#      If i remember right, i don't have this problem before.
#      It seems that too many color composition and matrix math is the main #      cost.but i already have an idea in my mind~~~see 15.
#      shader.uniformi cut off almost 10 fps!
# 7. optimization. play with numba or Cython or PyPy.
	seems that Cython is the way to go.
	PyPy is much much slower than CPython in my case.
	numba .. I can't get it installed on windows.
#14. Don't use opengl api to do matrix calculation
	Done.Need a optimization later.
#15. try to implement a dirty render state algorithm.
	Dropped.Not that flexible.
#16. try to map all leafs to a list.(not too hard)
	Dropped.Not that flexible.
#18. colors will not be truncated until it is going to display
	Do nothing.Opengl will do that work.
#23. use t2f instead of t3f.
	Don't need z-value for a tex_coord.
#27. fix rotation bug.
#28. fix sabi effect area not correct bug.
